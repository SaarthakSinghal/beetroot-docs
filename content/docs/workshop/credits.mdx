A huge thanks to all of the following:

## 1. Felix Yu

When it was decided that we are going to make a photo identification and clustering
application, I watched his amazing video on AWS Rekognition, and the way he explained throughout
the whole video while coding it at the same time, which really made the concepts clear.

## 2. Fumadocs

This is literally one of the best documentation framework by far. No doubt.

Whatever UI/UX you're seeing from the colour to the tabs, the callouts was all made by the
amazing team of <a href='https://www.fumadocs.dev/docs'>fumadocs</a> and they even made it **open-source**.

Come on 😭🤌

This is just too good. It's officially now the default framework me and our club, AWS Cloud Club
are gonna use the next time we'll build any project.

I mean, the amount of customisation this framework gives is just out of the class, there's a lot
more beautifications I can do this website, and all I have to do is import that from the <a href='https://www.fumadocs.dev/docs'>fumadocs library</a>.

  <Card title="Website" icon={<Globe className="text-yellow-300"/>} href="https://www.fumadocs.dev/docs">
  It's pronounced `foo-ma-docs` not `fi-you-ma-docs`. I literally got to know about that
  now while making this card.
  </Card>

  <Card title="GitHub" icon={<Github className="text-blue-300"/>} href="https://github.com/fuma-nama/fumadocs/">
  The whole website's source code is available here, and since the docs website is made on
  fumadocs only, you can see a real-life example on how to use any component.

## Special Thanks
