## You made it 🎉

You've built the full backend pipeline:

- upload photos → detect faces
- crop thumbnails → match/index faces
- store People + Occurrences in DynamoDB
- expose an API + return pre-signed URLs for the frontend

At this point, your backend is **production-shaped** (private buckets + temporary URLs), and your UI just needs the API endpoint.

## Frontend source code

Your frontend is already set up in this repo:

<GithubInfo owner="saarthaksinghal" repo="aws-images" />

<Callout type="info" title="Good news">
  Connecting the frontend to the backend is very simple and the exact steps are
  already written inside the repo's <code>README.md</code> file.
</Callout>
